                <p>
                    The goal of Paw Bytes Café was originally to have a better 
                    understanding of databases, React, Python, and the Twitter Api.

                <h2>Why did I create this project?</h2>
                <p>
                    I created Paw Bytes Café because I barely passed my Database Management Systems class. 
                    During my sophomore year of college, I was struggling with managing my mental health, school, jobs, and my family. With so much going on, especially with family, I was having a hard time keeping up with the material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had to decide between prioritizing my mental health or my grades. In hindsight, choosing my mental health is the obvious choice but that meant risking my scholarships, my status as a Kathwari Honors student, and even my status as a student overall. After deciding to prioritize my mental health, 
                    I made a promise to myself to relearn the material when I have the time.

                <p>
                    Paw Bytes Café is about a café for students and other people 
                    who are looking for a place to relax with cats and dogs while enjoying 
                    everything that the café has to offer.

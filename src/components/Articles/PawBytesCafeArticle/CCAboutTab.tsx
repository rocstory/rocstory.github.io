                    Colonial Carnival is a web application built for the residents at Western Connecticut
                    State University (WCSU).

                <p>
                    The goal of Colonial Carnival is to learn the fundamentals of website development.
                    I also wanted to challenge myself by bringing a
                    completely different type of Resident Assistant program to WCSU.

                <p>
                    I created Colonial Carnival to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I also wanted to bring a new program to the residents of WCSU.

                    Colonial Carnival is a virtual carnival for students
                    at WCSU to earn tickets after each game
                    to exchange for prizes such as gift cards, stationery, and other items.

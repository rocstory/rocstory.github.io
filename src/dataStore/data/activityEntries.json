        "summary": "The Kathwari Honors Program at Western Connecticut State University was founded to foster and nurture academic and civic excellence among outstanding students in all four WCSU schools. The Program consists of highly interactive and interdisciplinary classes and is built on the fundamental assumption that knowledge is an open set of questions and ideas to be explored, rather than a closed set of facts to be memorized. WestConnâ€™s Kathwari Honors Program is arguably one of the more innovative programs in the country. It is designed to expose students to fundamental modes of inquiry found in various academic fields, and to illustrate the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to exploring a topic or issue.",
